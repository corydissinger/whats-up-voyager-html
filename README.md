=====================
An interactive tour of the Voyager 1 mission.

Requirements:
- Google Earth browser plugin
- Optional: LeapMotion controller and driver; development release only as of June 2013

To run: 
- Open voyager-tour.html in browser of choice. Click the buttons in sequence to see specific points in Voyager's journey. The tour buttons flies along Voyager's coordinates from 06 Sept 1977 to 31 Dec 2020.

Known bugs:
- If the launch button is clicked out of sequence, the launch does not start from origin.
- If the day buttons are clicked out of sequence, the view does not always immediately switch to the correct coordinates.
- Timeline and historical imagery do not work in Sky mode for the Voyager path. Does the imagery exist in the Google database?
